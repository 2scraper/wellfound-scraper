wellfound-scraper — Puppeteer edition

Scrapes wellfound.com: role landing pages, the /jobs discovery feed, and
individual job pages.

    --mode role   /role/{role} · /role/r/{role} · /role/l/{role}/{location}
                  The rich one. Full job descriptions, the company's badges,
                  size and tagline, salary AND equity. Paginates.
    --mode jobs   /jobs — the discovery feed. One page, thinner rows.
    --mode job    /jobs/{id}-{slug} — one job from its schema.org block.

What is different about Wellfound
=================================

* **The data is not in the DOM, and there are TWO structured sources, not
  one.** A landing page carries zero JSON-LD blocks and a normalised Apollo
  cache in `__NEXT_DATA__`; a job page carries no `__NEXT_DATA__` at all and
  exactly one schema.org `JobPosting`. They are different applications.
  Pointing the listing parser at a job page returns zero rows in silence,
  which is why `--mode` selects the reader and `product_parser` pins that
  failure.

* **Gating is per ROUTE, not per site.** From a residential US exit,
  measured three times each on 2026-09-17: `/`, `/jobs`, every `/role/…`
  shape and `/jobs/{id}-{slug}` answered 200; `/company/{slug}` answered
  403 every time, and answered 403 to a real Chromium on that same exit too.
  From a datacenter address EVERYTHING is 403, including `robots.txt`.

* **The site loads Cloudflare Turnstile on its own good pages.** It ships
  `challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js`, publishes
  `CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` in its page config and renders a widget
  into `#turnstile_widget` when its own fetch wrapper is challenged. So the
  marker this family settled on elsewhere fires on GOOD pages here and is
  absent from the real refusal. Read `product_parser`'s marker comment
  before adding one.

* **Walking off the end of a listing does not fail — it repeats.**
  `?page=48` of a 47-page listing answers HTTP 200 carrying page 1 again.
  The response states which page the server really used, and this engine
  reads it.

Usage
-----
    python3 puppeteer_scraper.py --url "https://wellfound.com/role/r/software-engineer" --pages 3
    python3 puppeteer_scraper.py --role software-engineer --location new-york --pages 2
    python3 puppeteer_scraper.py --mode jobs --url "https://wellfound.com/jobs"
    python3 puppeteer_scraper.py --mode job --url "https://wellfound.com/jobs/4697947-senior-software-engineer"

A datacenter address gets nothing from this site. Use a residential
`--proxy`, or `--cdp-endpoint` for the 2Captcha Scraping Browser.
