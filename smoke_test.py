"""
Smoke_test.py — the offline suite for wellfound-scraper.

One file of plain functions with inline fixtures. No pytest, no conftest, no
fixtures directory; `tests/test_smoke.py` wraps this as a
single pytest test so `pytest` works as an entry point without a second copy
of the checks.

    python3 smoke_test.py            run everything
    python3 smoke_test.py -v         print every check as it passes

It must pass with NO engine library installed at all: every
`import playwright_scraper` / `selenium_scraper` / `puppeteer_scraper` is
guarded and the skip is RECORDED, because "skipped, engine absent" reads
identically to a real import error. CI installs each engine in its own venv
and fails if that engine's group reports a skip.

The fixtures below are cut from real captures taken 2026-09-17 and trimmed to
the companies and jobs the checks read. Every trimmed fixture was verified to
parse IDENTICALLY to its untrimmed original, field for field, before being
committed — the only deliberate difference is that each `description` is cut
to its first 200 characters, because a job description runs to six kilobytes
and forty of them would be most of this file.

Nothing here carries personal data: Wellfound's job and company objects name
companies, not people, and the parser reads no field that could hold an
individual's name. `check_fixtures_carry_no_personal_names` guards the SHAPE
so a future capture from a route that does is caught.

    That was a claim about BEHAVIOUR with no mechanism behind it — the word

    It is a CHECK rather than a runtime gate, and that is a decision worth

    eighteen repos of this family on 2026-09-16 it reported six problems and
    zero false positives.

    `check_undefined_names_in_every_module` cannot see this class at all, by
    design -- it pools every binding in the file rather than tracking scopes,
    so a name used inside dead code passes as long as anything else in the
    module binds it. What was hiding in that blind spot here, and in five
    sibling repos, byte for byte: a function whose `def` line had been lost,
    leaving its docstring and body absorbed into the end of the function
    above it. Present since this repo's first commit, invisible to import,
    `--help`, `compileall`, and every green run of this suite.
