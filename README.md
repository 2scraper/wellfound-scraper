Scrapes job listings from [wellfound.com](https://wellfound.com) (formerly
AngelList Talent): role landing pages, the `/jobs` discovery feed, and
individual job pages — with the company's size, badges and tagline, the
salary AND equity ranges, and the full job description.

Four ways to fetch — Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer, or the 2Captcha
Scraping Browser API over CDP — one output schema, and every number below
measured on a date that is written beside it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-playwright.txt
playwright install chromium

python3 playwright_scraper.py \
    --url "https://wellfound.com/role/r/software-engineer" --pages 3
```

---

## What you actually get

One row per job listing, 38 columns. Cut from a real run —
[`sample_output.json`](sample_output.json) and
[`sample_output.csv`](sample_output.csv) are ten of those rows.

```json
{
  "source": "wellfound.com",
  "url": "https://wellfound.com/jobs/4697947-senior-software-engineer",
  "sku": "4697947",
  "title": "Senior Software Engineer",
  "company_name": "Confident LIMS",
  "company_size": "11-50",
  "company_tagline": "The easiest way to test",
  "company_badges": ["Actively Hiring", "Top 1% of responders", "YC Funded"],
  "job_type": "full-time",
  "years_experience_min": 5,
  "posted_at": "2026-09-10T17:59:14+00:00",
  "remote": true,
  "remote_locations": ["Canada", "South America", "United States"],
  "compensation": "$100k – $180k • 0.05% – 0.25%",
  "salary_min": 100000.0, "salary_max": 180000.0, "salary_currency": "USD",
  "equity_min": 0.05, "equity_max": 0.25, "has_equity": true,
  "description": "…",
  "data_source": "apollo", "page": 1, "position": 1
}
```

Measured over 375 landing-page rows from 165 distinct companies, across six
live runs on **2026-09-17**:

| column | populated | why not more |
|---|---|---|
| `title`, `sku`, `url`, `company_name`, `company_id` | **100%** | the floor the run warns below |
| `description` | **100%** on landing rows, **0%** on the `/jobs` feed | the feed's records are a thinner type that carries none |
| `company_badges` | 92–98% | a company with no badges genuinely has none |
| `salary_min` | **83%** | 63 of 375 listings state no pay at all |
| `has_equity` | 33 say yes, 30 say "No equity", 312 do not say | `false` is a statement the listing made; `null` is silence |

Currencies seen: USD 303, INR 6, GBP 2. Company sizes: `51-200` and `11-50`
dominate at 127 and 126.

## Three modes

```bash
# 1. A role landing page — the rich one. Paginates.
python3 playwright_scraper.py --role software-engineer --remote --pages 3
python3 playwright_scraper.py --role data-scientist --location new-york --pages 2

# 2. The discovery feed. One page, thinner rows.
python3 playwright_scraper.py --mode jobs

# 3. One job, from its schema.org JobPosting.
python3 playwright_scraper.py --mode job \
    --url "https://wellfound.com/jobs/4697947-senior-software-engineer"
```

| mode | route | rows carry | paginates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `role` *(default)* | `/role/{r}` · `/role/r/{r}` · `/role/l/{r}/{loc}` | everything above | yes, `?page=N` |
| `jobs` | `/jobs` | no description, no job type, no badges | **no** — one address |
| `job` | `/jobs/{id}-{slug}` | adds `salary_period`, `benefits`, `industry`; no equity | n/a |

`--role r --remote` and `--role r` are **different listings**, not a filter
on one: `/role/r/software-engineer` reported 1,881 jobs and
`/role/software-engineer` a different set.

### The two sources agree, and that is checked

A landing page carries a normalised Apollo cache in `__NEXT_DATA__`; a job
page carries no `__NEXT_DATA__` at all and one schema.org `JobPosting`
instead. They are different applications, so `data_source` records which one
a row came from (`apollo` / `jsonld`) and `diff_runs.py` reports a change
that comes with a source change as `source_changed` rather than as a real
one.

Where both publish a salary they agree — job 4697947 is
`$100k – $180k` on the listing and `100000`–`180000` USD in the detail
page's `baseSalary`. The offline suite pins that.

## What is gated and what is not

**Gating is per ROUTE, not per site.** Measured 2026-09-17, three requests
each:

| route | datacenter (Hetzner, Helsinki) | 2captcha residential US exit |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | 403 | **200** |
| `/jobs` | 403 | **200** |
| `/role/{r}`, `/role/r/{r}`, `/role/l/{r}/{loc}` | 403 | **200** |
| `/jobs/{id}-{slug}` | 403 | **200** |
| `/company/{slug}` | 403 | **403** |
| `robots.txt` | 403 | 200 |

From a datacenter address **everything** is refused, including `robots.txt`,
and no browser gets past it: headless and headful Chromium both sat on
Cloudflare's "Just a moment..." for the full wait, 0 of 1 each.

From a residential exit every route this scraper reads answered 200 every
time — and `/company/{slug}` still answered 403, to plain HTTP **and** to a
real Chromium on that same exit. There is no `--mode company`, because there
is nothing this repo can honestly offer for it.

### Which captcha is on this site

**One vendor, and only one: Cloudflare.** Counted across 16 served pages and
4 real refusals on 2026-09-18 — zero occurrences of reCAPTCHA (v2, v3 or
Enterprise), hCaptcha, DataDome, PerimeterX, Incapsula, Kasada, AWS WAF,
Arkose/FunCaptcha or GeeTest. Not on the listings, not on the job pages, and
not on the login or sign-up pages either.

What there is, is **two different Turnstiles**, and telling them apart is the
whole story:

| | sitekey | where it lives | solvable from the markup? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wellfound's own** | `0x4AAAAAAAgpA-Qx7SsJOW-g` | published in the page config of the Next.js routes — 12 of 17 served captures | **yes**, the key is right there |
| **Cloudflare's challenge** | `0x4AAAAAAADnPIDROrmt1Wwj` | passed to `turnstile.render()` on the refusal and kept nowhere | **no** — it must be intercepted |

Wellfound's own widget is wired to its fetch layer: the site loads
`challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js` and renders into
`#turnstile_widget` when one of its own XHRs is challenged. It has not been
observed firing on a listing fetch.

Cloudflare's is what a scored address meets, and it arrives in **two skins
that are not equally solvable**:

| skin | who gets it | `_cf_chl_opt` | a widget on it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **"Security Check \| Wellfound"** — branded, the site's own styling | a plain HTTP client | 7× | **none at all** |
| **"Just a moment..."** | a real browser | 7× | yes, 1× |

The branded one has nothing on it for any solver at any price, which is the
only honest use of the word *unsolvable* — it describes that page, not the
product. The browser one does carry a widget, and that is the one this
scraper intercepts and solves (and whose token Cloudflare then refused — see
below).

### The marker that lies

`challenges.cloudflare.com` is on **14 of 16 served pages** and on only 1 of
4 refusals, because it is the site's own loader. `cf-turnstile` is on no
served page and on only the browser skin. So the obvious marker fires on
good pages and misses three refusals out of four.

`product_parser.BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS` uses the challenge's own bootstrap
vocabulary instead — `_cf_chl_opt`, `__cf_chl`, `orchestrate/chl_page` — each
**0 on every served page and present on all four refusals**. The offline
suite fails the build if the inverted marker is reintroduced.

## Do you need to pay for anything?

**You need a residential exit. Nothing else is required.**

That is the whole answer for the three modes this scraper has. A 2Captcha
residential proxy is one variable in `.env`:

```
WELLFOUND_PROXY=http://{user}:{password}@na.proxy.2captcha.com:2334
```

What the other paid products buy here:

* **Scraping Browser API** (`--cdp-endpoint`) — a browser you do not host,
  with its own residential exit and an auto-solve extension. Useful when you
  have no browser infrastructure, or want a persistent cookie profile.
* **Captcha solving** (`--twocaptcha-key`) — only reached if a challenge is
  actually rendered. On the routes above, a residential exit removes the
  challenge entirely, so most runs never touch this path.
* **Fingerprints** (`--fingerprint`) — a consistent device identity across
  runs. Not needed for anything measured here.

### About the captcha, precisely

Cloudflare's managed challenge **is** solvable — 2Captcha builds it as
`TurnstileTaskProxyless` — but the task needs `sitekey`, `action`, `cData`
and `chlPageData`, and a Cloudflare challenge page publishes **none of
them**: it calls `turnstile.render()` once and keeps nothing. So no static
read of the HTML can produce a solvable task, however careful.

This repo installs an init script on the browser context, before any page
script runs, that hooks `turnstile.render` and records its arguments. If a
sitekey is still not captured the run **refuses to build a task** rather
than paying for one the API will reject.

**And here is what that actually bought, measured 2026-09-17 from a
datacenter address**, because a claim about a paid product with no number
beside it is a guess wearing a fact's clothes:

| step | result |
|---|---|
| the hook captured the parameters | **yes** — `sitekey`, `action=managed`, `cData`, `chlPageData`, on every attempt |
| 2Captcha returned a token | **yes** — `TurnstileTaskProxyless`, 5–20 s |
| Cloudflare accepted it | **no** — the page stayed blocked |
| *control:* the block clears by itself | **no** — 0 of 8 reloads in the same session |

The control is what makes that a finding rather than an anecdote: a block
that expired on its own would produce the same observation as a token that
worked. It does not expire — eight consecutive reloads of the same page in
the same session returned HTTP 403 every time.

So on this site, from a scored address, a solved token did not get in
during testing. That is a statement about **this page and this exit**, not
about the product: the same challenge type is solved and accepted elsewhere
in this project family. What works here is a residential exit, which costs
less and removes the challenge entirely.

The run is bounded accordingly: `SOLVES_PER_PAGE` is 1 and **both** of the
engine's solve call sites are counted against it. That cap was not actually
enforced until this was measured — one call site was uncounted, so a single
page bought three tokens before the fix and one after.

The site's own widget is a different thing and is solvable from a static
read, because its sitekey is published in the page config.

## Engines

| engine | notes |
|---|---|
| `playwright_scraper.py` | **primary.** Full `--concurrency`, remote CDP. |
| `selenium_scraper.py` | cannot use an authenticated remote CDP endpoint — `debuggerAddress` takes a bare `host:port` with nowhere for a password. `--proxy-server` cannot authenticate either, so credentials are stripped and a warning printed. |
| `puppeteer_scraper.py` | pyppeteer is effectively unmaintained; its own README points at Playwright. |
| `scraper_api_client.py` | no local browser at all. Its own exits are datacenter addresses, so pass `--cdp-url`. |

All three browser engines agree on exit codes, run status, and whether a run
crashes or spends money — a shared `finish_run()` keeps that mapping from
drifting, and the offline suite asserts their flag sets against each other in
both directions.

**Install exactly one engine.** Playwright and pyppeteer declare mutually
unsatisfiable pins, and pyppeteer and selenium collide on `urllib3`. Use a
virtualenv per engine if you need more than one.

## Pagination, and the trap in it

A landing page states its own arithmetic, and **it counts companies, not
jobs**:

```
perPage: 20   pageCount: 47   totalStartupCount: 923   totalJobCount: 1881
```

Forty-seven pages of twenty **companies**, carrying between 32 and 45 job
rows each. Dividing 1,881 by 47 gives an answer that is wrong for every
page, which is why the sidecar records `total_jobs`, `total_companies`,
`per_page` and `pages_available` rather than leaving you to infer them.

**Asking past the last page does not fail — it repeats.** `?page=48` of a
47-page listing answers HTTP 200 carrying page 1's rows again. A run that
trusted its own request would re-collect page 1 for as long as it was asked
to and report success. Two defences:

1. the run **plans** against `pageCount` and never asks past it;
2. the response states which page the server actually used, inside the
   Apollo cache key, and a mismatch stops the run with
   `stop_reason=page_echo_mismatch`.

**`/jobs` is not addressable at all.** `?page=2` on it returns the identical
46 job ids as page 1, so `--pages 5` in that mode fetches one page and says
`single_page_listing` rather than reporting a complete five-page run holding
one page five times.

---

## Traps that look like bugs

* **`compensation` is one rendered string**, not numbers: `$100k – $180k •
  0.05% – 0.25%`. The `•` separates pay from equity and **either side may be
  absent** — 9 of 312 measured values are `No equity` alone and 2 are an
  equity range with no pay. `k` is 1e3 and **`L` is the Indian lakh, 1e5**;
  `₹30L – ₹80L` is 3,000,000–8,000,000, not 30–80.
* **`salary_period` is null on a landing row.** `$140k` reads as a year, but
  the page does not say so. The detail page does, and that is the only place
  the column is filled.
* **`has_equity: false` is not the same as `null`.** False means the listing
  printed "No equity". Null means it said nothing.
* **A "page" is twenty companies.** See above.
* **`years_experience_max` is almost always null** — 1 of 1,216 rows pooled
  across every live run. Wellfound's listings state a minimum and rarely a
  maximum. The column is kept because it is genuinely populated sometimes,
  not because the field exists.
* **`remote_kind` is null on 231 of 432 records.** The listing did not
  configure one; `remote` is the field to trust.
* **`/company/{slug}` is gated** even from a residential exit. Not a bug in
  your proxy.
* **`angel.co` redirects here and the redirect keeps your path** —
  measured, `angel.co/role/r/software-engineer` returns the same page as
  `wellfound.com/role/r/software-engineer`. The scraper still refuses the
  old host, so that one job never appears under two spellings, and the
  refusal says exactly that rather than "not a Wellfound site".

---

## Output contract

Exit codes: `0` ok · `1` crash · `2` bad usage · `3` blocked · `4` zero jobs
· `5` remote API error · `6` partial.

* **A run that finds nothing writes nothing** — last night's good output is
  never replaced with `[]`. `--allow-empty` opts out.
* **Blocked ≠ empty ≠ partial**, three distinct exit codes, and
  `<out>.meta.json` records `status`, `stop_reason` and *which* pages failed
  by number.
* **A failed run writes no sidecar**, so a `"failed"` file never sits beside
  good data.
* **An empty CSV still carries its header.**
* `diff_runs.py` refuses to compare runs that are not both `complete`, or
  whose modes differ.

---

## Configuration

Credentials live in `.env` next to the scripts, never on a command line — a
secret in `argv` is readable by anything that can run `ps`. Copy
[`.env.example`](.env.example) and fill in what you use. Precedence, highest
first: **explicit flag → exported environment variable → `.env` → default.**

```bash
python3 env_config.py     # prints what was picked up, without any secret
```

---

## Development

```bash
python3 smoke_test.py -v     # the offline suite; no engine library needed
pytest                       # same checks, through tests/test_smoke.py
```

The suite passes with no engine installed and *records* the skips, because
"skipped, engine absent" reads identically to a real import error. CI
installs each engine in its own venv and fails if that engine's group
reports a skip.
