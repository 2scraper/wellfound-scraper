diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old restaurants.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new restaurants.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run kept under a dated filename, diffed against
the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --text restaurants --location "New York, NY" \\
        --out "restaurants_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "restaurants_$(ls -t restaurants_*.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "restaurants_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new: the listing was
                   filled or withdrawn, or simply fell outside the pages this
                   run fetched
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different title, salary or
                   equity range, job type, remote configuration, location, or
                   company size. See TRACKED_FIELDS.
  source_changed — sku present in both, but one row came from a LANDING run
                   (`apollo`) and the other from a JOB page (`jsonld`), and
                   they differ on a column only one of the two fills.
                   Reported separately because this says something about our
                   own two snapshots rather than about the job — and
                   --fail-on-change deliberately ignores it.

TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE READING A DIFF OF THIS SITE
-----------------------------------------------------
**`removed` does not mean filled.** A landing listing paginates over
COMPANIES, twenty per page, and /role/r/software-engineer reported 47 pages
of them — so a two-page run holds a slice, and a job can leave the file
because the slice moved rather than because anything happened to the job.
Two runs are only comparable as a census when both fetched the same URL to
the same depth.

The site's own counts move too, and quickly: three requests for the same
listing within two minutes on 2026-09-17 reported `totalJobCount` of 1881,
1887, 1886 and 1874. The index is live; a small drift between runs is the
site, not a fault.

**`position` and `page` are deliberately not tracked.** The order in which
Wellfound serialises a page's jobs is not stable between requests —
measured 2026-09-17, two runs of the identical URL minutes apart returned
the identical 52 skus with eight rows in different slots. Diffing position
would report churn on every run. (Run back to back, all three engines agree
exactly: 0 of 52 positions differed.)

A row this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.

# What is worth watching on a job board, and nothing else.
#
# A price monitor's fields are absent because a job has no price — porting
# them would be dead code that looks load-bearing (CLAUDE.md §4). What
# changes on a job listing is its PAY, its TERMS and the COMPANY behind it,
# and those are what anyone diffs a job board for.
#
# `locations`, `remote_locations` and `company_badges` are lists and compare
# element-wise, which is what you want: a company losing its "Actively
# Hiring" badge is a real change.
#
# Deliberately NOT tracked: `position` and `page`, and `scraped_at`. See the
# module docstring for the measurement.

# period, the benefits and the industry, and no equity at all — schema.org
# has no expression for it. So diffing a landing run against a job run would
