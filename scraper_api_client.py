"""
wellfound-scraper — 2captcha Scraper API edition (fourth engine)

Fetches one page through the 2captcha Scraper API, which renders it on
2captcha's infrastructure and returns the HTML over plain HTTPS, and feeds it
to this project's product_parser.

When this path is the right one
-------------------------------
Every route this scraper reads is an ordinary HTML page whose payload is
serialised inside it, so there is no endpoint to prefer and no JavaScript to
execute after load — which makes a rendered-HTML service a genuinely good
fit for all three modes.

What decides whether it works is the EXIT, not the rendering. Measured
2026-09-17: from a datacenter address Wellfound answers HTTP 403 with a
Cloudflare challenge on every route, `robots.txt` included; from a
residential US exit it answered 200 on `/`, `/jobs`, every `/role/…` shape
and `/jobs/{id}-{slug}`, three times out of three. The Scraper API's own
exits are datacenter addresses, so pass `--cdp-url` to route the request
through a Scraping Browser session with a residential country segment.

`/company/{slug}` is refused from a residential exit too, and there is no
mode for it here.
