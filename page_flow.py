------------
The retry / solve / blocked decision, as DATA rather than as three copies of
an if-chain (CLAUDE.md §1).

Wellfound answers a request five ways, and four of them want a different
response:

    a rendered page with job records in it              -> parse
    a rendered landing page that matched nothing        -> parse, it is an answer
    Cloudflare's managed challenge, HTTP 403            -> solve, or rotate
    a page Wellfound served that we could not read      -> parse_error, dump it
    something else entirely                             -> wait, then retry

Three copies of that triage across three engines would drift, and the drift
would be silent — one engine reporting exit 3 where its twin reports exit 0
on the same response.

Nothing here imports a browser, and **no JavaScript crosses this boundary**:
Selenium's `execute_script` takes a function BODY with an explicit `return`
while Playwright and pyppeteer take `() => expr`, so a shared snippet would
quietly acquire one driver's dialect. The callbacks below are named for the
OPERATION instead, and each engine spells it in its own dialect (§1).
