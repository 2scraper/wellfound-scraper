output_writer.py
-----------------
Shared row model + JSON/CSV writers used by all three scrapers.

Three modes, one row shape
--------------------------
    --mode role   /role/{role}, /role/r/{role}, /role/l/{role}/{location}
    --mode jobs   /jobs                          the discovery feed
    --mode job    /jobs/{id}-{slug}              one job, described fully

All three yield the SAME class, because they are three views of one thing.
The leaf Wellfound publishes is a JOB AT A COMPANY: the landing routes and
the feed are two ways of selecting them, and a detail page is one of them
described more fully. So there is one dataclass here, and `diff_runs.py`
can compare a `role` run against a `job` run on the columns both populate.

What they populate is genuinely different, though, and that is why
`data_source` is a column rather than a sidecar field. A landing row comes
out of the Next.js Apollo cache (`data_source="apollo"`) and carries the
company's badges, size and tagline, the equity split and the full
description. A detail row comes out of a schema.org `JobPosting`
(`data_source="jsonld"`) and carries a stated salary PERIOD, benefits and
an industry, but no equity — schema.org has no expression for it. Neither
is a subset of the other. See `product_parser.py`'s docstring for the
measurement, including the check that where both publish a salary they
agree: job 4697947 is 100000-180000 USD in both.

The row is `JobPosting` and not `Product`
-----------------------------------------
Every shop repo in this family names its row `Product` and keeps the
commerce columns even where they are null, because on a shop a null price
is a fact worth recording. Wellfound is a job board: it has no price, no
currency on a product, no discount, no stock and no brand, and six columns
null on every row of every run of every mode is exactly what CLAUDE.md §9
says must not exist. `bbb-scraper` and `quora-scraper` are the precedent.

What a job board has where a shop has a price is a RANGE, which is two
columns and not one, plus an equity range that no shop has at all. Those
are `salary_min`/`salary_max` and `equity_min`/`equity_max`, and the site's
own rendered string is kept verbatim beside them in `compensation` so a
consumer can always see what was published.

What IS kept, byte-identical and in order, is the family prefix — `source`,
`scraped_at`, `url`, `sku`, `title` — so one column name works across the
family and a consumer reading several of these repos reads the same first
five columns in the same order (§9).

`rating` is absent, and that one is a measurement
-------------------------------------------------
Wellfound publishes no rating for a job or for a company on any route this
scraper reads: 0 rating fields across 432 job records and 210 company
records in the 2026-09-17 captures. The nearest thing is a company BADGE
("Highly Rated", "Top Responder"), which is a label and not a scale, and
those are in `company_badges`. A `rating` column would be null on every row
of every run.

Everything below the dataclass is row-class-agnostic: pass `row_cls` so an
empty CSV still gets the right header for the mode that produced it.

    and 1,881 jobs on 2026-09-17, and its pages carried between 32 and 45 job
    rows each. Nothing in the row count reveals that, and dividing 1,881 by 47
    gives an answer that is wrong for every page.

    `pages_failed` lists the pages that did not yield data, by number.
    `pages_completed` alone was enough only while pages were fetched strictly
    in order, where "3 of 10 completed" could only mean 1-2-3: a count is not
    a description once pages can be fetched independently and page 3 can fail
    while 4 and 5 succeed. Recording the numbers keeps the sidecar honest
